# How to display a regression line for a series

This example demonstrates how a [regression line](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/6231/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/series/indicators/simple-indicators/regression-lines?p=netframework) can be displayed for a series of the [Stock](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/2987/controls-and-libraries/chart-control/series-views/2d-series-views/financial-series-views/stock-chart?p=netframework) view type. Note that to access the collection of indicators, you should cast your series view to an appropriate type

To create a regression line, you should define a [value level](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraCharts.SingleLevelIndicator.ValueLevel) to which it corresponds.
